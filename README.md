# Void Fragments

A catalog of **Void Fragments**: isolated capabilities extracted from **Void Crystal** and released as independent building blocks.

Each fragment solves **one specific problem** and nothing more.  
Fragments are published through **OpsDevHub** once they are stable, understandable, and useful.

This repository is the **index, standards, and reference point** for all Void Fragments.

## What is a Void Fragment

A Void Fragment is an isolated capability that:

- Has a single, clearly defined purpose
- Is explicit in its behavior
- Can be composed with other fragments
- Can be used by humans, scripts, or agents

---

## Project relationships

Void Fragments exist within a small, intentional ecosystem:

- **OpsDevHub**  
  Public demos, discussions, and published building blocks.

- **Void Crystal**  
  Internal experimentation and validation environment.  
  Fragments originate here.

- **Void Fragments**  
  Isolated capabilities extracted and released for reuse.

If Void Crystal is the lab, Void Fragments are what survives it.
