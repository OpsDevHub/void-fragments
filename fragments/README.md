# Void Fragments Catalog

This catalog lists published **Void Fragments**.

Each fragment is an isolated capability that solves a specific problem.  
The goal of this catalog is to help you quickly understand **what exists**, **what it does**, and **whether it is relevant** to your work.

Implementation details live in the fragment repositories themselves.

### Field Matcher
**What it does**  
Matches fields between two systems based on semantic meaning rather than hardcoded rules.

**Useful when**
- Mapping schemas between systems with different naming conventions
- Aligning ERP, ecommerce, CMS, or PIM data models
- Reducing manual effort during discovery, migration, or integration work
